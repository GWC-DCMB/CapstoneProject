# CapstoneProject
Step by step goals for completing the Girls Who Code at UM DCMB Capstone Projet.

- At the end of each meeting the latest .ipynb should be uploaded to your Google Drive. Change the name to be \_v1, \_v2, etc as necessary. Make some notes in the notebook via  comments, in a Google doc, or in a group message on Slack regarding what you accomplished  and what you need to do.
- You can communicate with your group on Slack
- Check out the [how-tos](/howtos/README.md) if you're stuck on something!

## Data Analysis Step by Step

### Get organized!
- One partner should make a Google Drive folder and share it with group mentor and partner
- Start familiarizing yourself with your data. What are the data types in each column of the data set (e.g. float, string)?

### Hypothesis generation
- Refine the question or [hypothesis](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/a-strong-hypothesis) you want to explore in your project  
- Make a plan for what steps you need to take to answer the question  
- Sketch out potential plots including x and y axes  
  Example: Do women tweet more about Trump than men?  
  Step 1: Identify tweets about Trump  
  Step 2: Identify gender of the account  
  Step 3: Count how many tweets about Trump belong to women, men, or unknown  
  Step 4: Bar graph with y axis=number of tweets (discrete variable) and x axis=men vs women (categorical variable)  

### Data cleaning
- Start cleaning data programatically. Add commands to your .ipynb.
- You should be using pandas, check out [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html)
- To help with data frame manipulation in pandas check out this [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/groverpr/learn_python_libraries/blob/master/pandas/pandas_cheatsheet.ipynb)
- You should also be using numpy, check out these [exercises](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/101-numpy-exercises-python/) for more practice
- What variables do you need? What outliers should you remove? What variable has too much missing data to be reliable?
- Remember our example project [Jupyter Notebook](20171202-gwc_exampleProject_movieLikes.ipynb)
- A list of all the functions/methods/packages you've learned can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRYLVXATEQqqjyLVpLc1LIXsaxPoVe0vlP6qOxNvjR8/edit?usp=sharing)
  
### Data visualization
- Start visualizing your data using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py)

### Science communication!	
- Make presentation including Background, Methods, Hypothesis, Results
- [Template Presentation](GWC_presentation_template.pptx)
- [Template Presentation via Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18edFFZwETAB0TBxWg5-FhOL_oaJyFv0c-HON1H1jRgk/edit?usp=sharing)
- Review the [example presentation](project_example.pdf) by Rucheng Diao 
- Practice your presentation

## Goals by Date

December 3, 2019
- Select a data set
- Create ONE jupyter notebook through Google colab (remember paired programming) 
- Share the notebook (via Google Drive) with your group members and mentors
- Read in your data set using pandas, start exploring the rows and columns (look back at lessons & practices)
- Formulate a hypothesis or questions to guide your analysis
