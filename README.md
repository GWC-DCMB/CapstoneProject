# CapstoneProject
Step by step goals for completing the Girls Who Code at UM DCMB Capstone Project.

- At the end of each meeting the latest .ipynb should be uploaded to a Google Drive folder shared with your project group. Keep track of your progress in the notebook via comments, in a Google doc, or in a group message on Slack regarding what you accomplished and what you need to do.
- You can communicate with your group & facilitator on Slack!

## Data Analysis Step by Step

### Get organized!
- One partner should make a Google Drive folder and share it with group mentor and partner(s)
- Start familiarizing yourself with your data. What are the data types in each column of the data set (e.g. float, string)?

### Hypothesis generation
- Refine the question or [hypothesis](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/a-strong-hypothesis) you want to explore in your project  
- Make a plan for what steps you need to take to answer the question  
- Sketch out potential plots including x and y axes (do this on paper with your group)

### Data cleaning
- Start cleaning data programatically. Add commands to your .ipynb.
- You should be using pandas, check out [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html)
- To help with data frame manipulation in pandas check out this [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/groverpr/learn_python_libraries/blob/master/pandas/pandas_cheatsheet.ipynb)
- What variables do you need? What outliers should you remove? What variable has too much missing data to be reliable?
- Remember our example project [Jupyter Notebook](examples/example-project_movie-likes.ipynb)
- A list of all the functions/methods/packages you've learned can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRYLVXATEQqqjyLVpLc1LIXsaxPoVe0vlP6qOxNvjR8/edit?usp=sharing)
  
### Data visualization
- Start visualizing your data using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py)

### Science communication!	
- Make presentation including Background, Methods, Hypothesis, Results
- [Template Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bZFrjXwcXiRTNrnNOIGXKxTKWhcI2t-6jwqeCHh9_K8/edit#slide=id.p1)
- Review the [example presentation](examples/project_example.pdf) by Rucheng Diao 
- Practice your presentation
