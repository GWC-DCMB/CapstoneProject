# Gene expression x dermatology

Gene expression data for genes significantly associated with select dermatological phenotypes. This file contains the median TPM by tissue from GTEx. Medians calcualted directly from GTEx_Analysis_2016-01-15_v7_RNASeQCv1.1.8_gene_tpm.gct.gz from https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets.

TPM = Transcripts per Million. So, for every million reads in the RNA-Seq dataset, the data says how many contained each specific gene. For example, if the TPM value for gene XYZ is 15, that means that out of one million transcript reads, 15 of them contained gene XYZ.
