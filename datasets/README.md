# Capstone Project Datasets

## How to import a CSV file from GitHub in Python

Everyone will use the same `url` to this repository, then append a `filepath` for your dataset. 
For example, if you're using the [AP_exams](AP_exams) dataset, your filepath would be `AP_exams/ap_exams_MI_2018.csv`.

#### Example

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GWC-DCMB/CapstoneProject/master/datasets/"
filepath = "AP_exams/ap_exams_MI_2018.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url + filepath)
```

Be sure to update the `filepath` variable for your specific dataset!
You also may want to rename the `data` variable to something that's more descriptive for your dataset.

If you pick a dataset that's not in our GitHub repo yet, ask a facilitator to add it to GitHub for you.

## Datasets

**Goal**: Choose a dataset with enough interesting variables (number of columns) and a large sample size (number of rows). Think about what questions you could potentially answer and explore with the dataset. Pick a dataset that you find interesting and will be motivated to explore in depth.
