## Crowd-sourced tesla data

This dataset is from [tesladeaths.com](https://www.tesladeaths.com/), which states "Tesla Deaths is a record of Tesla accidents that involved a driver, occupant, cyclist, motorcyclist, or pedestrian death, whether or not the Tesla or its driver were at fault"

The `Tesla_Deaths.csv` file here was downloaded 2021-02-23, then cleaned up.

For a larger, more complete dataset of car accidents, see the [Vehicle Colissions](/datasets/vehicle_collisions) dataset.
