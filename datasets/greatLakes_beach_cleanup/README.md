# Great Lakes Beach Cleanup

**Summary:** This data includes information about trash that volunteer clean-up crews picked up along Lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie and Superior. Otherwise known as marine debris, volunteers recorded the number and type of trash collected. Volunteers are a critical part of keeping beaches clean and safe. This file contains data from [Michigan Sea Grant](https://www.michiganseagrant.org/lessons/lessons/by-broad-concept/social-science/data-sets/beach-clean-up-data-sets/).

**Sample Inquiry Questions:**

* What type of trash is the biggest contributor to beach debris?
* Is one type of trash more common in some places compared to others?
* Is there a relationship between the amount of litter collected and the number of volunteers?
* Is there a relationship between the amount of litter collected and the total time spent volunteering?
* Understanding outliers: What types of items contribute disproportionately to the total weight of trash? Does this affect the overall stats (pounds collected per volunteer hour)?
